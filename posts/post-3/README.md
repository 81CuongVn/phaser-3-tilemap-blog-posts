## Intended Audience

This post will make the most sense if you have some experience with JavaScript (classes, arrow functions & modules), Phaser and the [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor. If you don't, you might want to start at the beginning of the [series](https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6), or continue reading and keep Google, the Phaser tutorial and the Phaser [examples](https://labs.phaser.io/) & [documentation](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html) handy.

Alright, Let's get into it!

## About Me

I’m a creative developer & educator. I wrote the Tilemap API for Phaser 3 and created a ton of guided examples, but I wanted to collect all of that information into a more guided and digestible format so that people can more easily jump into Phaser 3. You can see more of my work and get in touch [here](https://www.mikewesthad.com/).
